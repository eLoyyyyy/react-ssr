# react-ssr

My Boilerplate code for server side rendered React project.

I've used the following to make this thing work:
* [Express ES6](https://github.com/ofkindness/generator-express-es6)

Run the following code:
```sh
cd react-ssr
npm install
npm run build:watch && npm start
```
and now you're good to go.
